**2D Top Down Shooter Wave Survival Game**
<br> This game originally started as nothing more then a school project. I've done a couple small projects in Unity before but they were mostly following tutorials. This was my first actual game made in Unity. I wanted to make something interesting for my Final Performance Task for grade 12 Computer Science. Since then, I've continued to develop it on an off, and I still come back to it sometimes.
